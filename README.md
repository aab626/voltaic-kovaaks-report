# Voltaic KovaaK's Report

This tool allows to visualize your progress within the Voltaic Fundamental Aim Training routines for KovaaK's.

## Update
When a newer version gets released, you can just download the latest release and use it, as the tool does not store any data at the moment.

## How to use
1. Download and extract the lastest release of the tool from [here](https://github.com/drizak/voltaic-kovaaks-report/releases).
2. Browse and select your KovaaK's Stat folder.
3. Generate reports.

The report will be generated in the same folder as the tool, in a `report.html` file.

## Building
Requires Windows with Python 3 (Tested using Python 3.9)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drizak/voltaic-kovaaks-report.git
cd voltaic-kovaaks-report
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then run the tool via `src/main.spy` or build an windows executable using `setup.py build`.
